It's been a long time since I've seen the colors
Of the sunrise breaking at the dawn
It's been a long night on the road to nowhere
But you found me somewhere in the dark
You caught me in the moonlight, pulled me up from under
Now I'm left to wonder, looking for your love
Falling through the hours, stuck inside my blue mind
Never wanna lose time, never get enough
I don't know what it means, but I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep, and now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
I'm feeling for you
I talk to streetlights down on every corner
But they don't know where I have to go
So I listen for your voice in a world so full of noise
One thing I hear, please don't disappear
You caught me in the moonlight, pulled me up to wonder
How you pulled me under, looking for your love
Falling through the hours, stuck inside my blue mind
Never wanna lose time, never get enough
I don't know what it means, but I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep, and now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
I'm feeling for you
I'm feeling for you
I don't know, I don't know
What it means, what it means
I don't know, I don't know
What it means, what it means
I don't know, I don't know
What it means, what it means
I don't know what it means, but I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep, and now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling I'm feeling for you
I'm feeling for you
(I don't know, I don't know)
(What it means, what it means)
I'm feeling for you
