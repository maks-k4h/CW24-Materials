Mirror, mirror
Who's the happiest?
Is it the lover or is it the beloved?
And mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?
You shot my heart
Like a bullet all alone
When you leave me just
Carry me slow home
Mirror, mirror
Can I blame you for this
When heartbreakers came around?
Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
And all I can do is to follow
Sadnecessary is what you promise me
All I can do is to follow the tears
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me
And all I can do is to follow
